# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was brought on as a request for further insights into the performance of schools in the Py City District based on current records of both school metrics and student metrics.

### Purpose

  The purpose of this analysis was to link the school data with the student data to find any link between metrics such as school size and school spending with the success rate of an individual student. This analysis can provide insights that will allow for the future planning of additional funds or potential restructurings that can maximize the success rate of the student. 
  
  The secondary purpose of this analysis was to eliminate the overarching effects of suspected loss of grade integrity, potentially occurring in the Thomas High School ninth grade data.  The effects on the district and school summaries were reanalyzed to account for this potential discrepancy.
  
  ### Effects on the School District Summary
  
  The district Summary was affected in a couple of ways, but none that seem to be of a major consequence. This is of course pending the application to rigorously adhered to funding programs where a one or a tenth of a percent, in a given metric, could be the deciding factor in grant approval. The differences in the District Analysis results with and without, respectively, the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School (THS) can seen in the two figures below.
